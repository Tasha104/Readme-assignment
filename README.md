# what is logging
Logging is the practice of recording information about events, processes, or activities, typically in the context of software development, systems administration, or network monitoring. logs include variety of information like error messages, sysytem events, debugging information and etc.

## Why logging is important?
Identifying Issues: Logs provide detailed information about errors, exceptions, and failures, which can help developers and system administrators identify the root cause of problems.

Predictive Maintenance: By analyzing trends in log data, organizations can anticipate and prevent issues before they occur, reducing downtime and improving reliability.

Compliance and Auditing: Many industries have regulations requiring the retention and analysis of logs for auditing purposes. Logs help demonstrate compliance with legal and regulatory requirements.

Capacity Planning: By analyzing logs, organizations can better understand resource usage patterns and plan for future capacity needs.

Cost Management: By tracking resource usage and identifying unused or underused resources, organizations can optimize costs.

### Understanding logging levels.
Logging levels, also known as log levels, are categories that represent the severity or importance of events recorded in logs.
DEBUS;
Purpose: Used for detailed diagnostic information. This level is primarily intended for development and debugging and often includes granular information about the system's state.
Typical Usage: Recording variables' values, system states, and the flow of the application. Often too verbose for production environments.

INFO;
Purpose: Provides general operational information about the system's state and progress. This level is used to record normal but significant events.
Typical Usage: Application start-up or shutdown, configuration changes, successful transactions, or other routine operations.

WARNING;
Purpose: Indicates a potential problem or an unexpected situation that does not currently prevent the system from functioning but might need attention.
Typical Usage: Deprecated APIs, nearing resource limits, or non-critical errors that could become more significant if not addressed.

ERROR;
Purpose: Indicates a significant problem that has occurred, typically one that has caused a failure in a specific operation or function.
Typical Usage: Failed operations, exceptions, or conditions that prevent the normal execution of a program. It often requires immediate attention.

CRITICAL;
Purpose: Represents severe errors that lead to the program's termination or a critical component's failure.
Typical Usage: System crashes, critical system component failures, or any event requiring immediate response.
